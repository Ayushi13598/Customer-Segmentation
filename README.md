# Customer-Segmentation
A clustering Problem

Need for Customer Segmentation:
Because every customer can not be treated the same way with same content, same channel and same importance.
To increase retention rate, you can do a segmentation based on churn probability and take actions.

Recency:
To calculate recency, we need to find out most recent purchase date of each customer and see how many days they are inactive for. After having no. of inactive days for each customer, we will apply K-means* clustering to assign customers a recency score.
